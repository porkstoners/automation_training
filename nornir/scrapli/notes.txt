What is Nornir: Automation framework for network device
 - Handles concurrency \ concurrent connections
 - Inventory management \ Inheritance 
 - Agentless - nothing required on the target network device
 - purely python based \ flexible \ leverage existing python code  
 - Extensible - works in tandem with [Napalm \ Scrapli \ Netmiko] 
  # If you use napalm vs nornir-napaplm - you have concurrency and inheritance 
 - similar to Ansible files are written in yaml but Ansible requires playbook (logic you use to pull the data)
   - Playbooks are written in yaml which is not a proper programming language 
 - Nornir - Faster \ more flexible \ Improved error handling
